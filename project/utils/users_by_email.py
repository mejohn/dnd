"""A User model that uses the email field as a login

This is an example file that is not used or imported by default. It shows how to
create a User model that uses email addresses as the login field.

It includes a custom UserManager that tweaks the createsuperuser management
command, and also a case insensitive email field.

If you wish to use this model, you should copy it over into your models file and
replace your existing User model. Then make and run migrations. Or if this is
your initial migration, delete it and re-create it.

NOTE: On postgres you must run "CREATE EXTENSION CITEXT" before the
initial migration to enable the citext extension.

    Email addresses are officially case sensitive except for the domain part,

    is handy when you want to allow case insensitive email address matching
    (for example, for a username field), while preserving case so emails
    actually sent will be delivered correctly to providers that are case
    sensitive.

    The downside for using this as a login field is that two users who
    legitimately have different email addresses differing only by case will
    not be able to both have accounts. That's probably rare, however,
    and something we may want to disallow anyways.
